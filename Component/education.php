                     Major depressive disorder or clinical depression has varying forms. It affects the way a person thinks, feels or functions. It’s about more than feeling sad once in a while — depression is persistent and includes symptoms like extreme low moods, difficulty concentrating, anxiety, exhaustion and social withdrawal. Symptoms vary from person to person. Psychotic depression can also include delusions or hallucinations. With support and sometimes medication, those with depression can live rich, fulfilling lives.

                     While anyone can experience anxiety from time to time, those with anxiety disorders experience persistent, excessive worry. Symptoms can include restlessness, fatigue, trouble concentrating, irritability, muscle tension and sleep problems. Panic disorders and phobias fall under the category of anxiety. Anxiety disorders are very common. About 31% of adults experience an anxiety disorder at some point in their lives. Helpful treatments can include talk therapy, medications, relaxation techniques and exercise.

                 <p class="text-body fst-italic mb-4">

                     The prevalence of PTSD and other mental disorders is high in conflict-affected settings (3). PTSD may develop following exposure to an extremely threatening or horrific event or series of events. It is characterised by all of the following: 1) re-experiencing the traumatic event or events in the present (intrusive memories, flashbacks, or nightmares); 2) avoidance of thoughts and memories of the event(s), or avoidance of activities, situations, or people reminiscent of the event(s); and 3) persistent perceptions of heightened current threat. These symptoms persist for at least several weeks and cause significant impairment in functioning. Effective psychological treatment exists.

                 Loneliness is a universal human experience, yet its prevalence has reached alarming proportions in recent years. Studies have shown that approximately one in three adults in many developed countries report feeling lonely. This phenomenon, often referred to as the "loneliness epidemic," has far-reaching consequences that extend well beyond momentary discomfort.
